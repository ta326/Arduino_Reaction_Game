{"name":"Welcome to ECE3140 project website","tagline":"Please edit me! ","body":"### Welcome to ECE3140 / CS 3420 GitHub Pages!\r\n\r\nThe repo is set up so you can easily edit the page using the online Markdown editor from GitHub. In order to access it \r\n\r\n* Go to \"settings\" in the repo\r\n* Scroll down to the section with GitHub pages\r\n* Press the \"Launch Automatic Page Generator\"\r\n\r\nThat should allow you to update (and remove) this text.\r\n\r\nYou are also welcome to use any other method to update/generate your course page. In order to update the material, push to the \"gh-page\" branch. Also note, that while the repo is private the **page content is public**. \r\n\r\n### For Lab 4 Please Update This Page\r\n\r\nYou should post some of your project ideas and the TAs will look at them and give you feedback on the scope, feasibility, and potential issues for you to think about. These project proposals are not final, and you can leave up to 3 ideas. If you do, please add a few sentences about the pros and cons of each and concerns you have about implementing them.\r\n\r\nOnce the webpage is updated, it should have the following sub-sections:\r\n\r\n1. Project Name \r\n2. Project Idea (a high level description of what the project does) (3-5 sentences)\r\n3. Anticipated difficulties (1-2 sentences for each concern)\r\n4. Additional supplies (if any) and how you plan to get them. \r\n\r\n \r\nIf you have multiple ideas, please add 1-4 for each idea an add a section that discusses their relative merits or concerns you have. This should not be much text at this point. If you end up choosing one of these ideas, great, but these ideas are not \"binding\" in the sense that you are held accountable for implementing them as your project. We want you to start thinking about the project and help you smooth out any difficulties early. \r\n\r\n### Project Idea 1 (Formatting Example) \r\n#### Catchy Name\r\n#### Description\r\nIn this project we will make an embedded system that does something useful. The approach is to read the output from X and then do some math on those numbers. We will use the approach from Lab X in order to accomplish both of these things, and then use concept Y from the lectures for making the project even better. We think that it would make a very good final video demonstration since it will show ZZZ in a fun way. \r\n\r\n####  Difficulties\r\nWe found source code for the math. We think we can use it because it is in C but are worried about getting it to work with Keil.\r\n\r\n####  Additional Components\r\nWe were thinking of adding a new sensor. We found one at this \"weblink\" for $3 and also a detailed description of how to use it at this \"weblink\". The sensor plugs directly into the board and we don't think we will need additional test equipment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
